\section{Introduction}
This report presents the development of a software project undertaken as part
of the Object-Oriented Application Development course at Chalmers University of
Technology. Over a period of eight weeks, our team of four students
collaborated to design and implement a structured and scalable application,
applying key principles of object-oriented programming and software
engineering. The project provided an opportunity to deepen our understanding of
system architecture, design patterns, and collaborative software development.
This report documents the development process, the technologies utilized, and
the overall experience of working as a team in a structured software project.

\subsection{Project Requirements}
The chat application is designed to provide users with a seamless and
interactive messaging experience. Users can easily connect to a chat, ensuring
real-time communication with others. A persistent chat history is maintained,
allowing users to access past conversations whenever needed. The application
supports sending both text messages and images, enabling rich and dynamic
interactions. Additionally, users can receive new messages or images instantly
when sent by others, ensuring smooth and continuous communication. Each message
or image clearly displays the senderâ€™s identity, allowing users to track
conversations effectively. These features work together to create an efficient
and user-friendly chat system.

\subsection{CRC Cards}
CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) cards are used in software design to
identify and define the key classes in a system, along with their
responsibilities and interactions. They help in breaking down the system into
manageable components by specifying what each class does and how it
collaborates with others. In this chat application, the identified classes
include User, Chat (room), and Message, with key responsibilities such as
viewing chat history, sending text messages and images, and receiving new
messages. However, additional classes are needed to manage server-client
communication and database interactions. CRC cards aid in structuring the
system effectively, ensuring clarity in design and functionality distribution.

Figure \ref{CRC cards} shows the CRC cards for the Chat Room and Message classes in the chat application. The Chat Room class is responsible for managing room members and storing chat history. It collaborates with the User class to handle room members and interacts with the Message, Message Handler, and Server to maintain the chat history. The Message class is responsible for managing message information and collaborates with both the User and Chat Room classes to ensure proper message handling within the application.
